# Autonomous Camera Tracking System with ROS

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository documents the development of an **Autonomous Camera Tracking System** using **ROS (Robot Operating System)**. The project focuses on creating a robotic platform capable of object detection, tracking, and control system integration.

### Project Highlights:
1. **Building the Physical Robot**
   - Design and CAD modeling of the robot.
   - Solving inverse kinematics using three levels of mathematics:
     - High school-level 3D vector geometry.
     - Jacobian method for robotics.
     - Automating calculations with ROS tools.

2. **Object Detection Using a Camera**
   - Implementing object detection algorithms.
   - Using ROS and camera sensors for real-time detection.

3. **Applying Control Systems**
   - Developing control algorithms for object tracking.
   - Achieving precise pan, tilt, and zoom motions for the camera.
